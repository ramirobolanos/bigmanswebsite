    title="Electric Stand Up Paddle Board"
    img="/Paddle Board.png"
    desc="Introducing the next innovation in electric paddleboard technology, an electric paddleboard conversion kit aimed at safety and performance. With most designs on the market taking one of two approaches, a sleek design with low battery life, or a bulky design which would be cumbersome to avoid on the board, this project aims to bridge the gap between the two with a sleek battery pack designed to slide seamlessly into a carrying bag. This project features a motor, impeller,  removable fin, rudder, and a discreet low-profile battery, with user control for speed and steering."

  title="Effects of Ambient Temperature on Cognitive Function"
  img="/brain.jpeg"
  desc="Machine learning is an emerging tool that has plenty of use cases and applications. As time progresses more refined use cases will be developed and used. One application that was tested by the team was the effect on temperature on cognitive function. Using a Muse 2 device (EEG device) and its data collection software, data was captured from various UBC students and subjected to cognitive function tests. This data was then cleaned, preprocessed and fed into multiple machine learning models. Accuracies were calculated and tabulated with the highest being XGBoost with 88%."
